    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface. Add the remaining ingredients to the center and use a fork to gently break up the eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best as you can!</li>
        <li>Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour. Continue working the dough to bring it together into a shaggy ball.</li>
        <li>Then, knead! At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not feel like it’s going to come together, but after 8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth:</li>
        <li>When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.<strong>Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker (level 1 on the KitchenAid attachment). I run the dough through the pasta maker 3 times on this setting before proceeding to the next step. If you don’t have the KitchenAid attachment, roll out the dough according to your pasta maker’s instructions.</strong></li>
    </ol>
